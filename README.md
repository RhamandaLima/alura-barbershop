### HTML5 and CSS3 part 1: The first web page

In this course the concept of HTML and CSS were teached, the basic structure of an HTML file and the beginning of the development of the Barbershop's webpage. 

In the basic structure, the teacher taught about structuring with the use of tags, for example: 

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="pt-br">
    
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Barbearia Alura</title>

    <h1>SOBRE A BARBEARIA ALURA</h1>

    <p>Localizada no cora√ß√£o da cidade, a <strong>Barbearia Alura</strong> traz para o mercado o que h√° de melhor para o seu cabelo e barba. Fundada em 2019, a Barbearia Alura j√° √© destaque na cidade e conquista novos clientes a cada dia.</p>

</html>

In addition, the use of CSS3 was presented, along with the teaching of hex colors, image display, lists, classes and content division, as well as the insertion of the header in HTML5. 

With this instruction I was able to develop my first web page.

### HTML5 and CSS3 part 2: Positioning, lists and navigation

In part 2 of the project I learned about navigation between web pages as well as CSS positioning, the difference between inline and block and CSS borders and pseudo-classes.

### HTML5 and CSS3 part 3: Working with forms and tables

In part 3 of the Alura Barbershop project, I developed complex forms that address mobile fields and table information. In addition, I understood and applied CSS hierarchy, and worked with transformations and transitions. 

### HTML5 and CSS3 part 4: Advanced CSS

Finally, in the 4th and last part of the project I worked with advanced CSS, as it was possible to import external content, such as fonts, videos and maps. Furthermore, I worked with pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, advanced CSS selectors, viewport and responsive design.
